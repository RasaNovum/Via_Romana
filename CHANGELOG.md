# Via Romana 2.2.1 Changelog:

### Features:
- Added `Disable GUI` config option which replaces GUI elements with mouse button actions.
    - Disables the whimsy (Sign Link and Charting Map GUI).
    - While holding the `Charting Map`, `right-click` to start and stop charting, `sneak right-click` to cancel charting (while charting) and remove nodes (while not charting).
- Added `Direct Warp` config option.
    - When enabled, the player will directly teleport to another linked destination if the network only contains two total destinations, if more than 2 destinations exist the Travel Map is displayed.

### Fixes:
- Resolved `FOV Effect` slider not being taken into account for `Path Movement Speedup`.
